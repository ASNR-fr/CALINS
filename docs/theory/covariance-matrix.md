# Covariance Matrix

The covariance matrix (Cov) is constructed from multi-group uncertainties on cross sections and their correlations (Corr). It is symmetric by construction.

The covariance matrix can also be interpreted as a composition of covariances sub-matrices, for each pair of isotope-reaction couples, aligned horizontally and vertically: (i<sub>h</sub>, r<sub>h</sub>)-(i<sub>v</sub>, r<sub>v</sub>).
